## Numerical_Statistical_Analysis
The main objective is to understand and implement various numerical and statistical methods to solve engineering, physical and real life problems.
- 
# Non-Linear Equation
- Bisection
- Fixed-point iteration
- Newton-Raphson's method for simple and multiple roots and order of convergence

# Linear System and Eigen Values
- Gauss elimination method using partial pivoting
 
# Interpolation and Approximation
- Lagrange (with error analysis)
- Newton's divided difference interpolation & Newton's forward interpolation

# Numerical Integration
- Newton-Cotes quadrature formulae (Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules)
- Gauss-Legendre quadrature

# Differential Equation
- Solution of initial value problems using Euler's Method
- Modified Euler's Method
- Runge-Kutta method for fourth-order

# Curve Fitting
- Curve fitting by the method of least squares- fitting of straight lines, second degree parabolas and more general curves.
